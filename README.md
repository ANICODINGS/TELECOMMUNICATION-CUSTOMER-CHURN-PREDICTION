# TELECOMMUNICATION-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION
In highly competitive service industries, customer churn is a major problem. Customer churn  rate is the percentage of a company's total customers that stop doing business or using services with the company over a specified period of time. Customers who left within the last month is  called Churn. clients or customers who are most likely to leave the company might represent a  large new revenue stream. It is classification problem. So, our objective is to predict whether  the customer is churn or not using Machine algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support  Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost, and XG Boost Classifier and do  comparative analysis on machine learning models. I have taken the telco customer churn  dataset from Kaggle consisting of 7043 records and 21 columns. In this 73% of the customers  are not a churn in that 37% are Males and 36% are Females. Minimum 16% of the customers  are not senior citizens. Maximum 33% of customers use electronic check payment method. Maximum 48% has no Multiple Lines. Maximum 55% of customers are having Month – to – Month contract. Maximum 43% of customers are having no online backup. I successfully  predicted using the five algorithms, and AdaBoost classifier gives greatest accuracy of 86.47%  in the training set and 80.12% accuracy in the test set. Now I can predict the new data using  the historical data with the best accuracy rate.
